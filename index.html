        <div class="faq-question">The app is not showing my correct location.</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Make sure you have allowed EninTow to access your location in your device settings. If you're in an area with poor GPS signal, you can manually enter your address. If problems persist, try restarting the app or your device.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">My payment method was declined.</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">Verify that your payment information is correct and that your card has not expired. If you're still having issues, try adding a different payment method or contact your bank to ensure there are no restrictions on your account.</div>

        <div class="faq-question">The towing provider canceled my request.</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">If your towing request was canceled, the app will automatically help you find another provider. If you're in an emergency situation, you can select the "Urgent Assistance" option to prioritize your request.</div>
